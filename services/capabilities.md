### Motors and Power Conversion
Generally, controlling power electronics is my specialty, whether that be directed at:
- Motors
- DC converters
- Inverters
- Architectural Lighting
- Spark Ignition

At Gradient, I worked on a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive, evaluating codebases, tuning, validating and debugging.  

At Lunar I worked on a 10kW grid-tied inverter, developing core controls and monitoring functions as well as interfaces for meeting grid-connection standards. 

Various personal projects have involved motor speed/torque control and high voltage and/or high current sub-circuits.

### About C++
I don't list C++ as a language I'm proficient with because most of my jobs used pure C as a policy to promote awareness of resource usage. Accordingly, my experience with the features from CPP11 and later is limited.  I would be more than willing to learn modern <nobr>C++</nobr> features for your project.
