I started kiteboarding in 2002, and since then I found myself in many situations where I was on the wafer after dark and either needed to locate my equipment or see my surroundings.   In 2016, I co-founded AquaVolta with Kim Harrison, another kiteboarding enthusiast, in order to make waterproof electronic lighting products for watersports.

Venturing out on the water after dark can add variety and excitement to any watersport, and we wanted to create a beautiful, low-impact product that would help to keep each other safe.  We started with a small light that could be attached to a kiteboard or other watersports board either using standard bolts or a custom stick-on mount.  The light could change colors or strobe, and we optimized the product for visibility and battery life.  The product was used by kiteboarders, surfers, stand-up paddleboarders others.  We designed the lights to be run-over-it-with-a-car durable and able to live on the board, recharging quickly in-situ without metal contacts which could corrode.

We kept much of the manufacturing in-house, including injection molding, foil stamping, coil winding for wireless charging and many others.  Although we have both moved on to other endeavors, we are sometimes pleasantly surprised to find our past customers finding new and exciting applications for these small but versatile lights.
