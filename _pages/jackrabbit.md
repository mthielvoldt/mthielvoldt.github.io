I founded Jackrabbit Devices with my father in 2011 to explore an improved accelerator design for motorcycles.  The "twist-grip" design had observable shortcomings related to the effort required to maintain grip and control throttle using the same muscles.

I designed and machined all of the parts, and observed improved performance for many users.  I was also surprised to find that many riders sought out this product because prior injuries had reduced the mobility of their wrists, preventing them from riding.  The two major challenges of the design were compatibility with different brands and models of dirt-bikes, and cultural resistance to changing the throttle type.  

In 2017, we were granted a [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9746872B2/en?oq=US9746872B2) on the accelerator design after prosecuting it pro-se.
