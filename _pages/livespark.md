Livespark, Inc. was born in 2008 when I connected with a friend and programmer over a shared love of art and fire.  We both saw a need for a new level of depth and nuance in flame effects, and for a product that would be easy for creative teams to design into live event spaces.  Our goal was not only to create high-definition fire, but also to make a robust product that could withstand use in harsh outdoor conditions while also creating a warm, expressive texture.  The effect we made is controlled with a variety of interfaces, always with an emphasis on responsiveness. The mechanical components are simple to integrate with almost any structure.  We named the product the “Fire Pixel”, and it has been incorporated into a wide variety of event sets, sculptures and art installations including the Disney Rivers of Light show in Orlando, Florida.

As the lead engineer and fabricator, I guided the company's first product through prototypes and into production, implementing purpose-designed flame sensing, gas shaping and real time tuning.  I sourced components, validated designs in the shop, built test platforms, managed vendors and CM's, fabricated showcase art installations, and much more.

As the demand for the product grew, I led a small engineering team that included software engineers, electrical engineers, fabricators and product designers.  I also took on responsibilities in various aspects of the business, including pursuit of intellectual property for the Fire Pixel which led to royalties and partnerships for the company.  With Livespark, I proved myself to be a technical generalist who could contribute to the company’s efforts wherever I was needed.
