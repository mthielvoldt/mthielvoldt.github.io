title: "Example portfolio project"
---
This is an example project in the portfolio collection.  Currently, I am not using the portfolio collection, so this is a placeholder.  Anything that goes in the _portfolio folder will appear alongside this post. 

The default layout is set in _config.yml, and is currently set to "single", which basically means a post.  For a more serious project, this is probably not the best layout.  

The permalink to the portfolio main page is defined in /_pages/portfolio.md

The portfolio is not presently linked in navbars.  To add it, edit _data/navigation.yml
