features:
  - title: Facilitate access with Web-UIs
    details: Websites give users <em>and</em> developers great experiences.  Let's build interfaces there, and get our users involved.
  - title: Write the most meaningful tests first
    details: At a project's beginning, we figure out what the product should do.  Let's reinforce that process by writing our first tests for that core functionality, and build from there.
  - title: Get our hands dirty
    details: Simulation is great, but it only takes you so far.  Let's equip ourselves for testing on real hardware, without breaking it.
