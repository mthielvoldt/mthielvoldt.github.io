# Habit 3
[Live Site][1] / [Code][2]

Inspired by Steven Covey's "7 Habits of Highly Effective People", this app is a skin on the Google-Calendar API that makes it easy to schedule time for the activities that are important, but might not otherwise get attention.  

It's currently an unverified app that accesses a google API, so you need to be a tester to use it.  Hit me up on the contact form if you'd like to be added as a test user and try it out.
