# Lite Invite
[Live Site][1] / [Code][2]

Like Partiful, but without sharing your friends' phone numbers with companies. 

This was my first web-app, which I made towards the end of following [Dr. Angela Yu's][3] [Web Development Bootcamp][4] on Udemy.  It features React and EJS templating (in different places), a MongoDB non-relational database and Express server.
