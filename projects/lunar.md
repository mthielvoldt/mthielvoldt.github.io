# [Lunar Energy][1]

I worked at Lunar for just under 2 years.  I began as the first firmware engineer directly responsible for the inverter, but that team grew to include 2 other engineers fully dedicated to the effort, and a supporting constellation. 

At Lunar, I learned that I enjoyed earning my colleagues trust as technical lead of the firmware department's power-conversion group, a.k.a. "Watt Squad".  My past experience as an educator, and my observations about effective leadership served me well.

In enumerated form, I did the following:
- Wrote performance-critical control code in collaboration with controls and electrical engineering teams.
- Managed requirements, architecture, and schedule for inverter functions, including safety and seamless backup.
- Led 6-member team responsible for developing IEEE-1547 grid interoperability features.
- Created software tool used company-wide to rapidly validate and diagnose controls on deployed hardware.
- Gave frontline support to manufacturing, reliability, EMC,  compliance, and system test teams throughout my tenure.
