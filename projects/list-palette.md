# List Palette
[Live Site][1] / [Code][2]

A checklist web-app with the ability to compose lists from other lists.

This app was one of the two that I built when I thought I wanted to be a web developer.  (see [Lite Invite][li-link])

It is born of three desires: 
- To learn SQL
- To learn trello-style drag and drop magic
- To make building grocery lists more fun
